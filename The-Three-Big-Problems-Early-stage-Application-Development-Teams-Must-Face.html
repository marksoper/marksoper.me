<p>
  Coming up for air after a few years of early-stage application development projects, I've gathered here some accrued thoughts on the surprise systemic problems that have crept in despite the best intentions of experienced teams.
</p>

<h2>
  1. The Arbitrary Decision Problem
</h2>

<b>
  Too much effort invested in making decisions when an arbitrary choice (that satisfies the fundamental requirement) is just as good
</b>

<p>
  Many teams pursue the MVP concept: remove superfluous features until the product is minimally viable. Within the context of each feature, however, teams often do not apply this kind of focus.
</p>

<p>
  This most obvious examples of this are features like User Settings that are required but don't really differentiate the product. Teams may invest heavily in custom design and engineering when there's little chance of meaningful UX improvement and high likelihood of a non-standard approach to some form input causing user frustration.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Coming soon: </em> An article on deriving UI specifications for features like User Settings from more fundamental specifications like a User model schema definition.
</p>

<p>
  Even when dealing with core features that truly differentiate the product, non-critical design and implementation decisions get fretted over, debated, implemented and re-implemented before anyone ever really uses the product.
</p>

<p>
  An example might be the message search feature in a chat app (What sort of autocomplete mechanics does it have? How should the results be formatted?, How are messages indexed on the backend?). What's important is that you have some data and users need to be able to reliably search it. You can come up with dozens of designs variations that meet the requirement. You don't know which is better. An arbitrary choice, made quickly (and ideally not incontrovertibly) is often the best choice. 
</p>

<p>
  It's hard to be too hard on ourselves for these challenges that are inherent in UI engineering: It's very hard to distinguish between which decisions are critical and which are not. And often it's necessary to implement a design and play with it before realizing it needs revision. But there are big gains to be made in developing better approaches to rapidly implementing and testing design variations that meet the fundamental feature requirements. 
</p>

<p>
  <em>Coming soon: </em> An article on deriving multiple UI implementations for a feature from fundamental specifications like schema definitions, user actions, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Another example is which components appear on which screen. Highly debated. Often layout are hard-coded around a specific choice. Should be possible to have several equivalent screen layouts in play, test which works best at various screen dimensions.
</p>

<h2>
  2. The Multi-Platform Problem
</h2>

<b>
  tablestakes
</b>

<p>
  It's no secret that building for multiple device platforms, device types, and screen-sizes is a huge UI engineering challenge. What's surprised me as a long-time web developer is the extent to which it's a deep problem with critical system design implications everywhere in the product and huge strategic implications for the business.   
</p>

<p>
  The problem goes beyond just supporting iOS and Android smartphones and tablets. Almost every company communicates with users via email, which many business owners are surprised to learn often merits its own UI/UX design and engineering processes. New platforms and devices are constantlye emerging.
</p>

<p>
  The last thing an entrepreneurial team needs is to be caught up in redundant parallel development tracks building for web, iOS, Android, etc., trying to ensure UX consistency, observe DRY, reconcile worthwhile learning about the domain across several development projects. 
</p>

<p>
  Solutions to the problem vary widely with the situation. Responsive design can be attractive for web apps, especially those that tend toward content and away from complex interaction. Hybrid approaches to native apps bring the rarely-fulfulled promise of "write once, run anywhere". In reality, desktop web apps and native mobile apps are often so different that separate design/dev paths are required in any case and trying to share code between the two becomes problematic as you approach a "viewish" level of the stack where markup and UI events are involved.
</p>

<p>
  Spreading precious startup resources across multiple redundant design/dev projects is such a huge cost ...
</p>

</p>



<h2>
  3. The Different Designs Problem
</h2>

  <p>
    <em>UI/UX design</em> and <em>Software design of UI software</em> are two different things.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>UI/UX design</b> - typically done by a professional designer, this involves working with the product's business owner to get the product vision out of his/her head and into a <b>visual representation (wirefreames, mocks, etc) of the user experience (UX) and associated user interface (UI)</b>.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <b>Software design of UI software</b> - typically done by a professional (front-end) software engineer, this involves creating a <b>plan for program(s) that the team will be building, with modularity and data management</b> as the key considerations. See Leslie Lamport's excellent work on getting the message out about the importance of "blueprints" before jumping into coding.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Most teams focus on the former and neglect that latter. The mocks stand in as software design. In the worst case scenarios the team jumps into coding up the mocks without thinking about software design. In a better but still wrong scenario, the engineering team <em>derives a software design</em> from the mocks - something like "drawing boxes around these mocks I see we're going to need the following 24 UI components and our model layer will have these 8 models.
  </p>

  <p>
    The right way to do this is to have someone (the UI engineer) engaged in software design from the very beginning, working in parallel with a designer who's focused on UX, and the product owner who has the vision. A lot more collaboration is required up front, but doing this right means you have just created an <b>"application design"</b> that encompasses both UI/UX and software design. Critical considerations like modularity and how data will flow across the entire system play a first class role alongside equally important considerations like aesthetic, look-and-feel, usability, and good UI design patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
    A good way to compensate for the the extra collaborative cost incurred is to constrain the scope of both design inputs. Defer "arbitrariable decisions" whenever possible. Don't worry about pixel-perfection. Typography, colors, and other style guide issues can probably wait. In terms of software design, keep it very low level, thinking about the core data model that this thing will run on, and the fundamental user actions and other events that are meaningful to the product.
  </p>
