<p>
Coming up for air after 2 years of back-to-back early-stage startup projects, I'm thankful to have a chance to reflect on why web/mobile application development is so difficult and how it could be better for everyone involved.
</p>

<p>
The overall process feels a lot more difficult than it needs to be. I think there are 4 major reasons why.

<h2>
  1. Too much fretting and debate required to make design decisions that may as well be arbibtrary
</h2>

<p>
  Even for a well-conceived, MVP-minded product, many of the features are not differentiative. User settings and account management, for example, aren't going to make or break your app, but you need them. In addition to the standard stuff for these features, your app may have special requirements, but very likely they arise from the need for the user to configure basic properties of the User or some other data model in your system. These properties are of standard types for which good input form patterns are well established. There's little incentive to innovate, be creative, debate options, or otherwise invest in design for such features.
</p>

<p>
  Within the core of your UX, in dealing with those features that truly do differentiate your product, countless design and implementation decisions get fretted over, debated, implemented and re-implemented before anyone ever really uses the product. An example might be the message search feature in a chat app (What sort of autocomplete mechanics does it have? How should the results be formatted?, How are messages indexed on the backend?). What's important is that you have some data and users need to be able to reliably search it.
</p>

  2. Too many devices/platforms/screensizes to build for

</h2>

<h2>
  3. The problem of multiple design levels
</h2>

  <p>
    UI/UX design and software design of UI software are two different things.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      UI/UX design - typically done by a professional designer, this involves working with the product's business owner to get the product vision out of his/her head and into a visual representation (wirefreames, mocks, etc) of the user experience (UX) and associated user interface (UI).
    </li>
    <li>
      Software design of UI software - typically done by a professional (front-end) software engineer, this involves planning the program(s) that the team will be building. See Leslie Lamport's excellent work on getting the message out about the importance of "blueprints" before jumping into coding.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The problem is that the existence/importance of these two levels, and how they inter-relate, aren't well appreciated by early-stage product teams. The most common incarnation is where a designer does UI/UX design, producing a design spec (mocks/wireframes), and the team concludes "design is done", let's get coding. It's a rare designer who has the experience to produce a design that addresses both levels, and it's not just a skillset issue. The engineering team should be involved in both levels but absolutely has to be inolved in the second level.
