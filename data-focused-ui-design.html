        <h2>
          Two Problems with Typical UI/UX Design As It Is Currently Done
        </h2>

        <p>
          New application design typically means producing a visual representation of UI/UX &nbsp;
          (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe">wireframes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockup">mockups</a>, <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">clickable prototypes</a>) that serves as requirements for the subsequent development phase.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are two major problems with this typical approach:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            As development evolves, the product increasingly deviates from the design, meaning there&rsquo;s no longer a definitive specification that product owners, developers, designers, QA, etc. can use for a shared understanding of the product.
            One symptom of this problem is that there isn&rsquo;t a single consistent and precise notion of the product that can be used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation">instrumenting for analytics</a> (reasoning about the production system for business and technical purposes).
            The team may lack a common language for referring to the various screens, components, features, etc. involved in the UI, making it hard to map analytics events back to specific behaviors the user executed in the product.
            Turing award-winner and distributed systems expert <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie Lamport</a> describes this problem of <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184705-who-builds-a-house-without-drawing-blueprints/fulltext">building a house without blueprints</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The typical visual forms (wireframes, mockups, clickable prototypes) require the team to sort out details of the UI that aren't critical to early user acceptance.
            Much effort goes into decisions about layout, navigation, aesthetics, and lots of other aspects that may not improve user experience.
            As an example, consider a team deciding between whether (a) the user composes a new message within the visual context of the message thread,
            or (b) the user is taken to a different screen for composing new messages.
            In my experience this kind of feature can be a source of lot of lateral movement in the project - debates among the team, prototyping it one way and then the other way - that cost valuable time.
            Often the right answer isn&rsquo;t knowable without user testing and the right answer varies with screen-size: (a) is right for desktop while (b) is right for smartphone.
            Ideally the initial design would deal with this issue at a higher level: &ldquo;users must be able to compose new messages&rdquo; and leave the rest to implementation.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          A Proposed Data-Focused Approach To UI/UX Design
        </h2>

        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s consider a different approach that solves these problems and has the potential for big gains in speed to implement, quality, and malleability of the resulting application.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Step 1: Visual UI/UX Design
        </h3>

        <p>
          Similar to the first step in the traditional approach, design begins with product owner, developer, and designer
          working together to get the product vision out of the owners&rsquo; heads and into a visual representation of the UI and UX.
          <a href="http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/#product-design-sprint">The Product Design Sprint process as described by Thoughbot</a> provides a good overview of the considerations involved in this step.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference here is that this step needn&rsquo;t have all of rigor required when the goal is to produce a requirements specification.
          The team can deal with a high-level representation of the product's user experience and work quickly by deferring details.
          While digital tools like Invision can be used, whiteboard, pen/paper, simple wireframes should be sufficient.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Step 2: Software System Design
        </h3>

        <p>
          Using the output of Step 1 as a guide, the team works together to produce a functional
          software design specification for the data that drives the system.
          I propose that two data-description formats are sufficient as a design specification from which to infer functionally conformative UI variations: <b>Entities</b> and <b>Events</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s consider an example:
        </p>

        <h4>
          Example: Entities
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>The system must provide an entity called <b>User</b> which has properties name, email, etc.</li>
          <li>The system must provide an entity called <b>Message</b> which has properties body, timestamp, photos, etc., and has one-to-one relationship with User as sender, has one-to-many relationship with User as recipient, etc.</li>
          <li>The system must provide an entity called <b>Photo</b> which has properties url, height, width, etc., and has many-to-many relationship with Message as attached, has many-to-one relationship with User as uploader, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
          Example: Events
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>The system must provide an event wherein a <b>User creates a new Message</b></li>
          <li>The system must provide an event wherein a <b>User sends a message to one or more Users</b></li>
          <li>The system must provide an event wherein a <b>User views a received Message</b></li>
          <li>The system must provide an event wherein a <b>User views a list of received Messages</b></li>
          <li>The system must provide an event wherein a <b>User updates a Message to include one or more Photos</b></li>
          <li>The system must provide an event wherein the <b>System scores messages according to a relevancy algorithm</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These two design formats should seem familiar:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Entities</b> are just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_schema">conceptual schema</a> in the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling">data modeling</a> context, could be specified using a pattern like <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html">Active Record</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Events</b> are very much like the kind of user and system behaviors an instrumented product would be kicking off to <a href="http://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> or the like.
            Note that many of the Events follow from basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD functionality</a> for the Entities,
            UI for which is already automatically generated for scaffolded admin UI in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django MVC</a> frameworks.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Step 3: Rapidly Generate UI that Conforms to the Software System Design
        </h3>

        <p>
          Drawing upon existing precedents such as Active Record model view/edit UI scaffolding
          and incorporating proven UI design patterns,
          middleware can be created that rapidly generates UI components and layout variations that conform to the rules.
          The team can evaluate these variations and make initial choices for initial testing with early users.
          Initial UI choices can potentially be customized based on the feedback from this testing.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Open Questions
        </h2>

        <p>
        This approach assumes that for a certain significant class of applications (new development, CRUD-heavy, basic UI requirements),
        product owners are better served by selecting from a set of arbitrary application UI variations that conform to all relevant constraints as stated in the formats above.
        </p>
