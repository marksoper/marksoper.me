<p>
  As a freelance software engineer I've had the opportunity to work with many early-stage teams over the past few years.
  I've become especially interested in the overall collaboration among these teams:
  product owners, designers, engineers, QA, analysts, etc.
  I'm convinced that how the entire team works together is critically important to the success of the product.
  I'm also convinced that there's a growing need for improvement in the process and tools teams use to collaborate, especially
  with respect to a shared understanding of the fundamental design specification. We need a way for everyone to reason about how the
  product is supposed to work.
</p>

<p>
  I think we in the engineering community already get this. We hear the term "easier to reason about" used constantly to
  explain major trends (e.g. functional programming) and technologies (e.g. React.js) whose popularity has exploded in recent years.
  Collectively we've realized the cost of incidental complexity and are taking steps to fight it.
  But I question whether everyone else involved in software products is benefitting from these anti-complexity efforts.
  Is it any easier for a designer or product manager to "reason about" a web app made with React than one made with Angular or whatever?
</p>

<p>
  We in the engineering profession can and should do a better job of communicating and making available our anti-complexity
  advancements more broadly to the business interests we serve and the everyone else involved the product lifecycle.
  I believe that the best way to do this is to pursue technology and process improvements
  that increase <em>data fluency</em> within teams and companies. Long gone are the days when
  data models were an implementation detail closely guarded by a few engineers and DBAs hiding out in a basement office.
  In today's world, and increasingly so, everyone on the team and everyone in the company must be able to understand and manage the data
  that powers the product and ultimately, the business.
</p>

<h2>
  GraphQL as a platform for data fluency
</h2>

<p>
  Expanding data fluency beyond engineering requires a more declarative,
  comprehensive approach to describing and processing data, a way to work with the DNA of a system that's
  approachable without programming experience.
  In 2015 Facebook made available <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html" title="GraphQL">GraphQL</a>,
  a technology with promising implications for developing such an approach.
  I believe GraphQL is promising because it provides a expressive <em>type system</em> that's not tied to any programming language
  or DBMS. It's well suited to maintaining a central data model that works with various front-end languages, in any back-end language
  environment, and with data from multiple disparate databases. GraphQL also supports queries, expressions of specific combinations of data
  associated with a UI feature. The type system is a declarative way to describe the shape of data system-wide, and the query language represents a
  declarative way to describe the shape of user interfaces to that data. Together these two aspects make GraphQL a promising as a foundation
  for data fluency.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to learning more about and contributing to existing efforts in the GraphQL ecosystem,
  I'm researching several specific areas where I believe GraphQL will begin to improve data fluency among entire product teams.
</p>

<h2>
  Making data schema accessible to entire teams
</h2>

<p>
  Extensions to Facebook's graphical IDE - named (perhaps confusingly) <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> - to support defining and
  managing GraphQL type system definitions. Increasingly entire teams need to work with the system’s data model. This UI provides that capability.
</p>

<h2>
  Admin UIs with which entire teams can manage system data
</h2>

<p>
  A UI component generator for creating admin interfaces that the entire teams can use to manage system data. Admin UI tools a la Rails are improved upon through GraphQL’s introspection and client-specific queries to make more powerful, product-oriented admin UX.
