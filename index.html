            I'm a UI/UX Developer based in Cambridge, MA.  I've designed and built consumer web and mobile products for early-stage startups as a co-founder or initial dev team member since 2007.  Before that I helped companies in financial services and other industries do big data management and analytics as an enterpise software systems engineer.

            <p>
              A goal for 2013 is to create an interactive story that the kids and I will love doing together.  A first step toward that goal is getting up to speed with tools available for graphics and animation.  Not having a lot of skill/experience as a graphic designer, I'm looking at ways to write code that will produce the visuals for the experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I did some <a href="http://imaball.com/" title="Imaball Interactive Story Experiments">experimenting with canvas drawing/animation around a simple story concept of a ball</a> rolling along as the main character of a story, generating <a href="http://genjs.co/demos/color/randomShade.html" title="Gen.js Color Shade Demo">color shades</a> and <a href="http://genjs.co/demos/arc/painterlyArc.html" title="Gen.js Painterly Arc Demo">canvas arcs</a> along with redrawing to create a rolling animation.
            </p>
            <p>
              While there are great javascript libraries available for drawing, animation, game development, etc. already out there, I couldn't find the tools I wanted to do generative art, where algorithms make many of the decisions normally made by the artist, and couldn't find tools designed to produce the painterly aesthetic that I wanted.  So I started build a set of tools myself.  Learn <a href="http://genjs.co" title="Gen.js - Javascript Library for Generative Art">more about Gen.js</a>.

              Working with a UI/UX designer and another developer, I designed and implemented initial build/tooling/workflow process for supporting wide range of device platforms (iOS, Android, web, etc.).

              Product technology specifics are confidential. I learned a lot about, evaluated and implemented technologies in several categories: 1) Javascript client frameworks like Ember, Backbone, Angular, etc. 2) Javascript build and tooling technologies like Yeoman, Grunt, etc. 3) Hybrid native/web bridge technologies like Phonegap, Titanium, Trigger.io, etc. 4) DOM libraries like JQuery, Zepto, etc. 5) Javascript testing tools like Mocha, PhantomJS, Jasmine, Selenium, etc.

              I created a service called <a href="http://www.mitforumcambridge.org/events/concept-clinic-featuring-touted-com/" title="CEO Mark Soper pitches Touted.com at MIT Enterprise Forum Concept Clinic">Touted.com</a> in 2009 to aggregate Twitter conversation about local businesses to help consumers discover the best bars, restaurants, etc. nearby.  The service pivoted to become Rally and focus on the long-tail of local events to help people make casual plans with friends.
            </p>
              Rally mined Twitter for content related to the future, extracting data about date, location, event, people involved, conversation thread, etc to build a calendar of future events in users' social graphs.  The main user experience was a daily email that aided last-minute planning.  While the daily email was successful among initial users (5% daily clickthrough rate), attempts to discover a workable distribution model failed, and the service was shut down in 2011.
            </p>
            <p>
              I designed and developed all aspects of the Rally product, from email and web user experiences to Python / Django API with Twitter Streaming API integration, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, Amazon AWS, etc.
