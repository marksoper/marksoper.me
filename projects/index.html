              With three boys under four at home, my wife and I do a lot of early childhood books and games.  Touch tablets are redefining how parents and kids experience stories together, and there is amazing new creative stuff out there.  But I'm always feeling like I look at the bookshelf or iPad home screen and don't feel all that interested <em>myself</em> in any of the options.  Apps or books may be great for kids but if they're not fun for me then I'm likely to be less involved.

              In 2012 I came to few realizations:  I love the way lyrics - from hip hop to Dr. Suess - mix rhythm and message to go straight to the heart.  I'm passionate about better ways for kids to learn and be creative.  And I'm interested in how software can be used to generate graphics, animation, and music.  I know how to design and build web and mobile products because I do that for a living, so I committed to a long-term goal of making interactive story experiences that I, and I hope other parents, will love doing with their kids.
