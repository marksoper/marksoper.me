            <p>
              With three boys under four at home, my wife and I do a lot of early childhood books and games.  Touch tablets are redefining how parents and kids experience stories together, and there is amazing new creative stuff out there.  But I'm always feeling like I look at the bookshelf or iPad home screen and don't feel all that interested <em>myself</em> in any of the options.  Apps or books may be great for kids but if they're not fun for me then I'm likely to be less involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2012 I came to few realizations:  I love the way lyrics - from hip hop to Dr. Suess - mix rhythm and message to go straight to the heart.  I'm passionate about better ways for kids to learn and be creative.  And I'm interested in how software can be used to generate graphics, animation, and music.  I know how to design and build web and mobile products because I do that for a living, so I committed to a long-term goal of making interactive story experiences that I, and I hope other parents, will love doing with their kids.

              Working with a UI/UX designer and another developer, I designed and implemented initial build/tooling/workflow process for supporting wide range of device platforms (iOS, Android, web, etc.). I defined and implemented the initial application architecture, played a strong role in UI/UX design, and helped define/implement customer development and usability testing.

              Product technology specifics are confidential. I learned a lot about, evaluated and implemented technologies in several categories: 1) Javascript client frameworks like Ember, Backbone, Angular, etc. 2) Javascript build and tooling technologies like Yeoman, Grunt, etc. 3) Hybrid native/web bridge technologies like Phonegap, Titanium, Trigger.io, etc. 4) DOM libraries like JQuery, Zepto, etc. 5) Javascript testing tools like Mocha, PhantomJS, Jasmine, Selenium, etc.

             The fifth employee at Connected Sports (backed by Avalon Ventures) I was the primary developer for the Javascript / HTML5 front-end for the company's first version of the Rumble Football product and built much of the supporting Node.js REST API. A social 2nd screen companion game experience for watching NFL on TV, Rumble Football involved real-time communication using Web Sockets and Socket.io, use of the Backbone front-end framework, JQuery, JQuery UI, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Redis.

            <p>
              I created a service called Touted.com in 2009 to aggregate Twitter conversation about local businesses to help consumers discover the best bars, restaurants, etc. nearby.  The service pivoted to become Rally and focus on the long-tail of local events to help people make casual plans with friends.
            </p>
              Rally mined Twitter for content related to the future, extracting data about date, location, event, people involved, conversation thread, etc to build a calendar of future events in users' social graphs.  The main user experience was a daily email that aided last-minute planning.  While the daily email was successful among initial users (5% daily clickthrough rate), attempts to discover a workable distribution model failed, and the service was shut down in 2011.
            </p>
            <p>
              I designed and developed all aspects of the Rally product, from email and web user experiences to Python / Django API with Twitter Streaming API integration, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, Amazon AWS, etc.

              I founded Likematter in 2008 to help people discover relevant news and job listings on the web.  Likematter built profiles of personal interests from favorited content like bookmarks, blogs (OPML), etc., crawled the web for current news and job listings, and the recommended highly relevant new content using machine learning and natural language processing based on the OpenCalais entity extraction platform.
