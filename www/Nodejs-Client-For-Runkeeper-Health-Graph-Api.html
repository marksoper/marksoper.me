<p><a href="http://runkeeper.com" title="Runkeeper">Runkeeper</a> is a service that improves your fitness experience through the mobile device you probably already carry when you go for a run,
bike ride, etc.  It tracks your workout in a bunch of helpful ways, but really excels at making solo sports 
training a more social experience.  Runkeeper is used heavily by a group of Boston tech cyclists and on a recent ride we cooked up
an idea for a service that combines charitable donation with fitness training in a new way.
With the recently announced <a href="http://blog.runkeeper.com/new-feature/health-graph" title="Runkeeper Health Graph API">Health Graph API</a>
opening Runkeeper to development, we set out to hack something up.</p>

<h2>Why Node.js for a Startup Project?</h2>

<p>Having used <a href="http://blog.soper.me/Server-side-DOM-manipulation-in-Nodejs-with-JSDOM-JQuery-and-Mustache-Templates-April-25-2011.html" title="Server-side DOM manipulation in Node.js with JSDOM, JQuery, and Mustache Templates">Node.js for a couple of contract projects</a>, it seemed well-suited for this,
a startupish side-project with a lot of uncertainty about the target we&#039;re trying to hit.
<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node" title="Node.js on Github">Node.js</a> is great for this situation because it means I can think about the overall architecture for the service in a single,
javascript-based context.  Why is this valuable?  For example, decisions like whether to build a single-page app or a render 
pages more traditionally from the server can be made with less concern for future switching-costs because (if done carefully) 
most of the page-building logic can be re-used between browser and server.</p>

<h2>Creating a Node.js Module for the API</h2>

<p>We needed to create a way to bind to the <a href="http://developer.runkeeper.com/healthgraph" title="Health Graph API Home">Health Graph API</a> from Node.js, so it made sense to package this wrapper as an open-source Node.js module.  The <a href="https://github.com/marksoper/node-runkeeper" title="Node.js Client for Runkeeper Health Graph API">Node.js Client for the Runkeeper Health Graph API</a> is now available in an immature but functional state <a href="https://github.com/marksoper/node-runkeeper" title="Install Node.js Client for Runkeeper from Github">via Github</a>, with npm distribution likely to follow. I welcome comments, feedback, bug reports, enhancement pull requests, etc.</p>

<h2>What&#039;s the Startup Idea?</h2>

<p>We&#039;re keeping the idea very hush-hush.
The only thing we can talk about right now is that the user experience will not require
or even encourage the wearing of mobile phone outfits for long endurance workouts.</p>
