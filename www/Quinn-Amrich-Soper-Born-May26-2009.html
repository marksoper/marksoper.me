<p>It&#039;s hard to believe Quinn was born only two months ago today.  Here&#039;s a photo log of our lives since then.</p>

<p>Some recent movie footage of you smiling and kicking as you&#039;re going to bed.</p> 
<p>

</p> 

<p>Been smiling for less than a month now, but already seem like an old pro.</p>

<p>You seem to enjoy singing songs with your mom &amp; dad - a couple of favorites are <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/gdead/agdl/ripple.html">Ripple</a>, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/13638873/Wishlist-Chords-by-Pearl-Jam">Wishlist</a>, and <a href="http://www.songsforteaching.com/folk/shellbecominroundthemountain.htm">She&#039;ll be Coming around the Mountain</a>.  Hopefully your dad&#039;s singing and guitar playing will improve faster than does your ability to escape.</p>

<p>You also enjoy reading along with your mom.  You&#039;re really focused on the book.  Your dad on the other hand &amp;#8230;</p>

<p>You&#039;ve been hiking several times, at Middlesex Fells, and here at Estabrook near Concord, MA.  You usually enjoy checking out the trees.  This time you were mainly sleeping, an activity which you also enjoy a great deal.</p>

<p>We went to Preston&#039;s 1st Birthday party hosted by the Faris&#039; just across the border in Michigan.  There was kickball, baseball, jungle-gyms, remote-control cars, pizza, cake, and of course, one of our favorite pastimes &amp;#8230;</p>
