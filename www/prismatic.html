      A video submission for the Prismatic <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UcnK8MOlspbZGp8A4WcjZ2I_um18uRtfSUsMVXV_KPM/edit"> interaction design take-home problem</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Note: This is not meant to be complete treatment of the interaction design.  I had about an hour today to begin this and wanted to go ahead and share my framing of the problem and proposed solution at a high-level before the holiday weekend.  And create the possibility for an earlier feedback loop ... </em>

      Some background on me ... I recently starting using Prismatic for a nascent startup idea: producing an email newsletter for parents that summarizes parenting, education, and kids-tech news of the week - something like Javascript Weekly or what Dave Pell's doing with Next Draft, but specific to parenting.  I've been experimenting with Prismatic as a discovery tool and really <a href="https://twitter.com/marksoper/status/337744747261206528">liked the parenting topic on Prismatic</a>.

        As I started using the product and looked into the company, I became interested in contributing to what you're doing.  I started a <a href="http://marksoper.me/Find-Breaking-News-And-Jobs-With-Likematter.html">company called Likematter in 2008</a> to solve the news discovery problem using NLP (I relied on OpenCalais for entity extraction), machine learning, and personalization.  While the company failed and I've been doing <a href="http://marksoper.me/#projects">UI/UX design and development in several other domains since</a>, I'd love a chance to take another crack at this problem!
